# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

It contains two Notebook files:

### Model Training (train_model.ipynb): For training a Speech Emotion Recognition model using LSTM and MFCC features.
### Voice Prediction (voice_prediction.ipynb): For recording own voice, preprocessing it, and predicting the emotion using the trained model.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify speech emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.) using audio data. The model is trained using the MFCC features extracted from speech files and uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to learn from the time-dependent nature of audio signals.

### Emotions Detected:
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Fear
- Neutral
- Disgust
- Pleasant Surprise (PS)

## Model Output
After running the prediction file, the predicted emotion will be printed to the console.
